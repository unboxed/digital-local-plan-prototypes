// Paragraph-level excerpts from the evidence base, for the "View policy
// summary" prototype's evidence search.
//
// Searching a term opens a modal listing these as excerpts, ranked by
// relevance, so a policy officer can select the passages worth keeping and
// copy them out. Each excerpt records the document it came from and the
// policies it supports, using the same policy refs as app/data/policies.js.
//
// ALL OF THIS IS INVENTED PROTOTYPE CONTENT. Document titles are the sort of
// evidence base an LPA holds, and the policy refs are City Plan 2040
// references, but the passages themselves are written for the prototype and
// are not quotations from any real study. Don't quote any of it as real.
//
// The corpus is deliberately broad rather than deep: it covers every term the
// search's type-ahead offers, so a demo doesn't dead-end on an empty result.
