// Content for the Statement of compliance prototype.
//
// Regulation numbers and titles are genuine — The Town and Country Planning (Local Planning)
// (England) Regulations 2026 (SI 2026/186), Part 4 (Local Plans). Descriptions are this
// prototype's plain-English explanation of what each regulation requires, not quoted legal
// text. The audit log history, dates, officers and planned activities are entirely invented
// illustrative content for a fictional plan.
//
// A requirement's status is DERIVED from how much of its full history has happened yet in the
// draft snapshot (draftEntryCount), rather than stored separately — so "Partially met" always
// means "some but not all of this requirement's history has happened", not a second,
// independently-set signal that could disagree with the audit log shown underneath it. The
// "completed" variant always shows the full history and "Fully met" for every requirement.
//
